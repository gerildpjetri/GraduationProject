In software world new techniques,methodologies and solutions emerge in an extremely
rapid rate with respect to our reasonable capabilities of knowing and mastering at least
the most popular ones.
Having the need to academically examine such techniques empirically not subjectively
is a must for engineers who desire to provide the business with undisputable results
and consequently convince the real world on strength and weakness of the popular
methodologies which they are about to use.
The Microservice Architecture is an emerging architectural pattern that has attracted
much attention in the industry for architecting backend systems.
Various articles and materials are written about architecting and migrating to this
trendy architecture, but as with anything else that becomes trendy in humans , developers and engineers grow a tendency in usage of the methodologies without knowing
empirically the benefits that goes with the implementation.
iv
In this thesis a study of effectivity in communication between microservices is treated
aiming to clarify engineers or business analysts on the power of three major possible
techniques, especially messaging technique used in communication between microservices.
Such study has taken place in local machines and must not be regarded as a final
conclusion for business decisions but it offers a clear picture on performace metrics
respectively throughput, processing time and response time of the requests thrown
upon microservices.The analysis is obtained by examining three most common types
of communication: Http Synchronous Rest, Http Asynchronous Rest and Kafka messaging.
